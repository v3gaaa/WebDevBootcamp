                <li>Collaborated with a team of three to complete the project over a two-week period as part of a final project for a
                    high school elective.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h4>PISA Learning Improvement Project</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a dynamic reading habits improvement program for high school students using object-oriented
                    programming, and database management techniques.</li>
                <li>Designed a easy-to-use graphic interface using Tkinter that simplifies the questionnaire process.</li>
                <li>Leveraged the pandas library and Excel to seamlessly manage large datasets and effectively store user information.</li>
